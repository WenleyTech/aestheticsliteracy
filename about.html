    <h2>Our purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Aesthetic treatments move fast—new techniques, new devices, new claims. Aesthetics Literacy exists to help people understand
      what procedures are, how they work, what they typically treat, and what questions to ask before choosing care.
    </p>

    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Explain:</strong> Treatments, terminology, and “how it works” basics.</li>
      <li><strong>Clarify:</strong> What outcomes are realistic vs. exaggerated marketing.</li>
      <li><strong>Support decision-making:</strong> What to ask a provider, what credentials matter, and how to evaluate safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What we are not</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We are not a medical clinic and do not provide medical advice.</li>
      <li>We do not diagnose conditions or recommend specific treatment plans.</li>
      <li>We encourage readers to consult licensed professionals for personalized guidance.</li>
    </ul>
